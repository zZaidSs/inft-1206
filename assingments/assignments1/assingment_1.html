  <h1>Re: Eileen Dover university application</h1>
  <p>Dear Eileen,</p>
  <p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part of your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.</p>
  <h2>Starting dates</h2>
  <p>We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
    <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
    <li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.</p>
  <p>You can find more information about <a href="https://iamcat.blog">important university dates </a>on our website.</p>
