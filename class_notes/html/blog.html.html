   <h3>3. CAMPING </h3>
   <p>How about camping? Camping in the summer is a wonderful way to escape the hustle and bustle of daily life and immerse yourself in nature. Whether you prefer pitching a tent in a campground or venturing into the backcountry for a more remote experience, camping offers a chance to unwind and appreciate the beauty of the outdoors. Gather around a campfire, roast marshmallows, stargaze under the clear night sky, and wake up to the sounds of birds chirping in the morning. It's a great opportunity to disconnect from screens and reconnect with nature and loved ones.</p>
